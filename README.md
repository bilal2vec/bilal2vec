# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bilal

### UW SE '25 - I like working on systems programming and AI stuff

### Take a look at what I've been working on [today](https://bilal.software/now). <br /> You can find me [training neural networks](https://bilal.software/explore/), writing [fast machine learning libraries](https://github.com/bkkaggle/L2), making apps and websites, and writing up my notes on my [blog](https://bilal.software/blog/)
