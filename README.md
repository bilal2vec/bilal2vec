# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Bilal

## UWaterloo SE '25 â€” I like working with ML research and systems programming projects.

In the past, you could find me training neural networks, writing [fast machine learning libraries](https://github.com/bkkaggle/L2), and doing full-stack and mobile development.

If you think my projects (or me) are interesting please don't hesitate to contact me!

The best way to contact me is probably through discord: bilal2vec#8916

Alternatively, send me an email bilal.khan1@uwaterloo.ca or look me up on my [other online profiles](https://linktr.ee/bkkaggle)
